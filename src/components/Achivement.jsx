                <p className="text-sm  sm:text-lg  lg:text-2xl text-white text-center">Parker Solar Probe collected data pinpointing defining the origin of zig-zag-shaped structures in the solar wind called <span className="text-[#105BD8]">switchbacks</span>. The data showed one spot that switchbacks originate is at the visible surface of the Sun – the photosphere. Parker discovered that switchbacks were not rare, but common in the solar wind. This  raised a big question: Where do they come from? 
As Parker orbited closer to the Sun on its sixth flyby, less than 25 solar radii out. Data showed switchbacks occur in patches and have a higher percentage of helium than other elements. The switchbacks’ origins were further narrowed when the scientists found the patches aligned with magnetic funnelsrr that emerge from the photosphere between convection cell structures called supergranules.
In addition to being the birthplace of switchbacks, the scientists think the magnetic funnels might be where particles of the fast solar wind originate.

                <p className="text-sm text-white text-center sm:text-lg  lg:text-2xl">Understanding where and how the components of the fast solar wind emerge, and if they’re linked to switchbacks, could help scientists answer a <span className="text-[#105BD8]">longstanding solar mystery</span> : how the corona is heated to millions of degrees, far hotter than the solar surface below. The size of the corona is also driven by solar activity. As the Sun’s 11-year activity cycle – the solar cycle – ramps up, the outer edge of the corona will expand, giving Parker Solar Probe a greater chance of being inside the corona for longer periods of time. So what else the sun is hiding? And what new discoveries will the Parker solar probe bring?
